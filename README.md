# Alpha
Repository for Alpha, a plugin for [Allium](https://github.com/hugeblank/Allium).

Alpha was originally a program created by [roger109z](https://github.com/roger109z). Due to its bulkiness, I integrated it into the syntax/format that Allium accepts. roger109z has write access to this repository along with myself. Credit should go his way for most of the code.
## Installation
Assuming you used [gitget](http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/17387-gitget-version-2-release/) by Apemanzilla to install Allium, it should be as simple to install as putting:

`gitget hugeblank Alpha /plugins/alpha`

into the repolist script.

This code will be kept for the most part maintained alongside Allium as it is more of a demo plugin showing Allium's power than it is a plugin with a purpose.

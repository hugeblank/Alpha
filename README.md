# BetaBot
Repository for BetaBot, a plugin for BagelBot.

BetaBot was originally a program created by [roger109z](https://github.com/roger109z). Due to its bulkiness, I integrated it into the syntax/format that BagelBot accepts. roger109z has write access to this repository along with myself. Credit should go his way for most of the code.
## Installation
Assuming you used [cc-github](https://github.com/eric-wieser/computercraft-github) by [Eric Wieser](https://github.com/eric-wieser), it should be as simple to install as:
`github clone hugeblank/BetaBot /plugins`
otherwise, I commend your (unnecessary) efforts in making an install script using wget or something of that sort to grab each file.
